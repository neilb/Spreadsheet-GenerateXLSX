Revision history for Perl module Spreadsheet::GenerateXLSX

0.05 2019-12-17 NEILB
    - passing a value of undef would result in a warning when you generate
      the spreadsheet. Thanks to Johann Rolschewski for PR with fix.

0.04 2017-01-05 NEILB
    - Optional testsuite that checks whether generated spreadsheet reads ok.
      Uses Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX, or skips if that's not installed.
    - Changed req'd version of Perl to 5.008, to match Ref::Util

0.03_02 2016-12-30 NEILB
    - I had done a push on an arrayref, which caused some CPAN Testers fails --
      I need to get out of that habit.

0.03_01 2016-12-28 NEILB
    - Added a testsuite which generates a spreadsheet then uses
      Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX to check the generated file.
      Uses Test::Needs to skip if Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX not installed.
    - Specified min perl version of 5.010, as Ref::Util currently doesn't
      work on older perls.

0.03 2016-12-11 NEILB
    - The github repo was wrong in the doc. Sebastien Thebert++
    - Updated SEE ALSO entry on XLS::Simple, now I've played with it,
      and added a link to my recent blog post.

0.02 2016-11-29 NEILB
    - Added SEE ALSO section, with a list of other spreadsheet writing modules.
    - Changed one instance of // to ||, so it will work on older Perls.

0.01 2016-11-27 NEILB
    - First release to CPAN
